        <p>I'm Mathilde</p>
        <p>I grew up in Denmark and I went to university thinking I could change the world. I have a masters degree in Middle East studies and after graduation I worked as a project manager at university. I haven’t managed to change the world yet</p>
        <p>Last year I quit my job and moved to the UK. Life had changed, my partner got a job in Cambridge, and suddenly I had free time and I realised I was now able to pursue my dream: learning to code</p>
        <p>I like to build things</p>
        <p>I build this gearbot</p>
        <p>And this dinosaur skeleton</p>
        <p>I want to learn how to build things in code</p>
        <p>I have started my journey learning a bit of python. To help my partner learn more about the birds in our garden, I made a python function that can help him identify the birds. It can identify any bird, as long as it’s a robin, a black bird, a blue tit, or a chubby pigeon</p>
