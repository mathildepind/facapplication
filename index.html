        <p>I grew up in Denmark and I went to university thinking I could change the world. I have a masters degree in Middle East studies and after graduation I worked as a project manager at university. I havenâ€™t managed to change the world yet.</p>
        <p>Last year I quit my job and moved to the UK. Life had changed, my partner got a job in Cambridge, and suddenly I had free time and I realised I was now able to pursue my dream: learning to code.</p>
